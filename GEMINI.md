# GEMINI.md - Project Memory Bank

This document serves as a persistent context for the Gemini CLI agent to understand the "Bus Jam" style mobile game project.

## 1. Project Brief (projectbrief.md)

### 1.1. Core Requirements and Goals
This project is a mobile Unity game, inspired by "bus jam" or traffic puzzle games. The primary goal is to provide an engaging hyper-casual puzzle experience for mobile users.

### 1.2. Core Gameplay Loop
The game involves:
- **Passengers:** The parked cars on the game board.
- **Wagons:** The characters/people who are moving in a queue.
- **Stops:** Locations on the board.
- **Interaction:** A `Passenger` (car) is associated with a `Stop`. The stop takes a suitable `Wagon` (character) from the queue. The user has noted this naming convention is intentionally reversed.
- **Abilities:** Additional gameplay mechanics (details to be explored).

## 2. Product Context (productContext.md)

### 2.1. Why this project exists & Problems it solves
The project aims to deliver a fun and accessible puzzle game experience on mobile platforms. It targets players who enjoy hyper-casual puzzle games.

### 2.2. User Experience Goals
The game should be fluid and optimized for mobile devices, providing a smooth and enjoyable experience for puzzle lovers.

## 3. System Patterns (systemPatterns.md)

### 3.1. System Architecture & Design Patterns
The project adheres to:
- **SOLID Principles:** For maintainable and scalable code.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Likely used for managing global game states or managers (e.g., `AbilityManager`, `ConveyorManager` based on file names).
- **Object Pooling:** Implemented for performance optimization, especially crucial for mobile games to ensure fluidity by reusing frequently instantiated objects.

### 3.2. Key Technical Decisions
General code optimization is a priority to ensure a fluid experience on mobile devices.

## 4. Tech Context (techContext.md)

### 4.1. Technologies Used
- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Programming Language:** C#

### 4.2. Development Setup
Standard Unity development environment.

### 4.3. Dependencies
(No specific external dependencies mentioned beyond Unity/C#)

## 5. Project Folder Structure Overview

The project follows a classic Unity folder structure:
- `Assets/Resources`: Contains level data.
- `Assets/Scripts`: Contains C# scripts for game logic.
- Other standard Unity folders like `Assets/Prefabs`, `Assets/Scenes`, `Assets/Materials`, etc., are also present.

## 6. Progress (progress.md)

### 6.1. Current Status
The game is under development, featuring "wagon" cars, "passenger" characters, "stops", and "abilities".

### 6.2. Known Issues / Next Steps
(No specific issues or next steps were provided, but this section is reserved for future updates.)
